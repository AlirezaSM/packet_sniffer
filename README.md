# Packet Sniffer
This project is a packet sniffer in the **Linux environment** implemented in pure python. It is for the Computer Network course at my university.<br>
You can try it just by executing main.py.
```
python3 main.py
```
**`report.txt`** generated at the end and reports some statistics about received packets.
